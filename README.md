# MDC-100 Series of Codelabs

MDC 101:
* We added text fields and buttons and hardly had to consider layout code.
 Material Components for Flutter come with a lot of style and can be laid out almost effortlessly.
 
MDC 102:
* Our app has a basic flow that takes the user from the login screen to a home screen,
 where products can be viewed. In just a few lines of code,
 we added a top app bar (with a title and three buttons)
 and cards (to present our app's content). Our home screen is now simple and functional,
 with a basic structure and actionable content.
